            <h2 class="section-heading">Group Progress</h2>
            <p>We definitely fell behind this past week when it comes
            to how much we wanted to have done already. However, we have
            been able to get the phase vocoder working more smoothly and
            sound better. In addition, we have figured out the problem
            with the LSM9DS0 and Bluefruit and can now get correct data
            through the Arduino IDE. We did want to already have the data
            on the phone, but we were not able to do so this week.</p>

              <b>Robert Keller:</b>
            Did more research on phase vocoders in general and learned that
            most phase vocoders only stretch or compress songs by a maximum
            of 30% (aka from 70% slowdown to 130% speedup). Because of this,
            he adjusted the algorithm to only fit this range to make the music
            sound relatively good. Also, he was able to change the algorithm
            to allow the altered music to gradually make a tempo change
            instead of it abruptly changing by adding an extra parameter
            to the function that tells it how much it should start changing.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Julian Trulear:</b>
            Figured out the connection problem between the Bluefruit and the
            LSM9DS0. Was able to get the Bluefruit to read off data from the
            LSM9DS0 and display that on the Arduino Monitor. Is now working
            on how to get that data into Android Studio to be able to display
            it on the phone.
            <p>
              <b>David Yuan:</b>
            Mainly worked with Julian to figure out the issue with the
            Bluefruit and LSM9DS0. While Julian was working with connection
            issues, he worked on getting the necessary buttons and layout
            on our app to have it ready to go when necessary. Is starting
            to figure out how the first 3 modes of our project will be
            implemented in our app.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Goals for Next Week</h2>
            <p>Have the phase vocoder pretty much completed with at least
            the altered song sounding relatively good and it being as real
            time as possible. Also convert it into C++ from the Matlab
            code. Have the data from the Bluefruit be displayed
            on our Android app through Bluetooth so there are no wires
            necessary. Have the UI of our Android app completed so that
            there is no delay from getting our data into Android Studio and
            then putting it in our app.
