            <p>This week was the mid-demo presentation, and we worked on
            creating sample data to show for it. We first worked on the 
            phase vocoder to change the song speed multiple times throughout
            one song. We also worked on getting the gyroscope data from the
            Bluefruit to our app. Unfortunately, we found out that the data
            being sent to the app was not usable at all. The numbers made no
            sense and weren't even consistent. We did not realize this
            until the day before our demo presentation, so we had to create
            something very quickly using the gyroscope on the phone. With this
            we were able to get consistent readings and even show the RPM.</p>

              <b>Robert Keller:</b>
            Created a miniature demo that showed that our phase vocoder
            could change speeds multiple times throughout one song by
            breaking the song into different windows and manipulating those.
            Quality of sound, however, was relatively poor, and he is
            looking into how to fix that issue. Advice from Professor
            Sullivan was to look into analyzing the song frame by frame
            instead of breaking it into chunks. He has started looking
            into how that is manageable and what implementations have
            already been created.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Julian Trulear:</b>
            Helped Rob with the phase vocoder demo and how it functioned.
            Mainly worked with David in order to get the data from the LSM9DS0
            to the Android phone. Unfortunately, the data that was being sent
            was not usable, so is now working with Arduino to check and make
            sure that the LSM9DS0 isn't broken. Has also been checking solder
            connections as they have been coming apart from time to time, and
            that is a priority fix. Worked with David on creating the, 
            hopefully, temporary gyroscope app that uses the phone's gyroscope.
            <p>
              <b>David Yuan:</b>
            Worked with Julian on the Android app and receiving data.
            With the LSM9DS0 not sending correctly, decided to use the
            phone's gyroscope as a backup plan. From there, he was able to
            calculate how we would use that data to get the RPM of the bike.
            Also touched up on the UI of the gyroscope app to make it fit
            on screen a little bit nicer. He was also the one that got the
            bike for us to start working on.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Goals for Next Week</h2>
            <p>Have the phase vocoder output a nicer sounding music signal
            and start working on analyzing it to make it more real time.
            Experiment with the LSM9DS0 and Bluefruit with Arduino to make
            sure that they are sending the correct data. Make sure that the
            LSM9DS0 is wired correctly with the Bluefruit as a TA mentioned a
            missing capacitor. Have the UI of the application that we
            eventually use to be cleaner and display only the information
            that we need.
